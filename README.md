# CarRental
Beginner project that involved designing and implementing a GUI-based Car Rental Management System using NetBeans. Integrated a MySQL database with multiple interconnected tables to support rental management functions such as booking, vehicle availability, and customer information. Applied drag-and-drop GUI design for an intuitive user experience.
